# Time Tracker App

This Time Tracker App is a web application used to track the amount of time that daily activities take.

## Demo

A functional version of this web application can be found [here](https://time-tracker-app-static-site.onrender.com/).

## Motivation Behind the Project

As someone who values efficiency, I believe that tracking how much time various day-to-day activities take allows one to recognize the areas in their lifestyle which can be improved.

Tracking the amount of time that one spends on a certain activity also encourages them to be more focused and intentional when engaging in that activity, so as to maximise the amount of progress that can be achieved within a certain time period.

## Notable Features

- Ability to edit the details of the activity that is currently being tracked
- Unrestricted choice of color for each category
- Data visualization with donut chart

## Main Technologies Used

- MongoDB Atlas
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js

## Rationale for Choice of Technologies

The MERN stack was used in order to simplify development as the entire application can be written in JavaScript.

A NoSQL database was chosen instead of an SQL database as it allows for quick iteration and development since fields can be added without reconfiguring the database schema, which would be necessary in an SQL database.

## Potential Future Improvements

- Ability to pause and resume the activity that is currently being tracked
- Ability to add a time entry without first tracking an activity
- Option to use light mode instead of dark mode

## What I Learnt

- When working on the front-end design, focus on mobile-first design as it is easier to expand the design than to shrink it
- When using Git, many small commits instead of fewer larger commits so that less progress is lost should there be a need to revert to a previous version
- Using a CSS naming convention such as BEM makes choosing class names a much more straightforward task
